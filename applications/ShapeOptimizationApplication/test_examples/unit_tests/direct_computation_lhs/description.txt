In this folder, the direct computation of the lhs is tested.
The result is compared to the one obtained through the transpose and matrix multiplication operations.

TEST:
    1:
        Benchmark_halbkreis_32x16_multipatch_geometry.json 
        optimized_shell_3418_elements.mdpa

        - direct txt comparison of KRATOS_WATCH output -> same result expected
        - comparison of computation times -> shorter computation time with direct computation
